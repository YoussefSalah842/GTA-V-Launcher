A simple test project in C++, but we are trying and striving to develop and improve it.

Enhanced error handling for file operations.
Game logging to a file (game_launcher.log).
Support for custom game executable paths via the UI.
UI updates for toggling mods and clearer button states.
Improved error messages for folder creation and mod handling.
Instructions to run the launcher and customize paths.
This will allow users to run the launcher more smoothly, especially when troubleshooting potential issues.
